        <h2>About Webserv</h2>
        <p>
            Webserv is an HTTP server program built on top of the C++ programming language. This project is a part of the curriculum at 42Tokyo, an educational institution focused on programming and computer science. With a focus on performance and reliability, <strong>Webserv</strong> provides an efficient and robust solution for serving web content.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>
            Webserv is a single-process, single-thread HTTP server that employs the concept of event-driven programming, thereby ensuring efficient I/O multiplexing. The server uses the <strong>epoll</strong> system call provided by the Linux kernel, which is known for handling large numbers of concurrent connections with low CPU overhead. This I/O event notification mechanism allows Webserv to serve multiple requests concurrently within a single thread.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to maintain the scalability and robustness of the server, the design and implementation take advantage of object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++. Specifically, communication sockets with HTTP clients, communication sockets with CGI scripts, and passive sockets are all encapsulated as separate class entities. This encapsulation provides a clean and modular interface for socket operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            Polymorphism, a fundamental feature of OOP, is employed to standardize the interfaces of these classes. By treating different socket objects polymorphically, we can manage them using a unified interface. This design approach enables efficient integration with the epoll system call and thereby takes full advantage of C++.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the execution of CGI scripts, Webserv utilizes UNIX domain sockets, which allow inter-process communication (IPC) on the same host. This approach enables secure data exchange between the server process and CGI script process.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Webserv</strong> is a high-performance HTTP server built on C++. It employs epoll, a scalable I/O event notification mechanism, to provide efficient I/O multiplexing. Our server handles multiple concurrent connections using a single-threaded, event-driven model.
        </p>
        <p>
            It supports the execution of CGI scripts using UNIX domain sockets, ensuring secure inter-process communication on the same host. Moreover, it supports the handling of GET and POST requests, as well as automatic redirection.
        </p>
        <p>
            The server adopts an object-oriented design, encapsulating the communication sockets with HTTP clients, CGI scripts, and passive sockets as separate classes. By employing polymorphism, we offer a unified interface for socket operations, enhancing modularity and scalability.
